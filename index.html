									<p>Our company want to do Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and to make sure that its effective, we need 
										to properly analyze all of the customers we have. We need to properly discover which customers are potential customers 
										and which customers are a lost customers. The analysis we need to do are Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), 
										RFM Analysis, and Cohort Analysis so that we can analyze all relevant customer behaviors in dataset, segment them 
										based on their last time purchase (Recency), how many did they make a purchase (Frequency), and purchase value (Monetary) 
										scores. Lastly, with the help of that scores, we will be able to predict their behaviors to retain our customers by 
										helping decision makers develop CRM programs.

								<header class="text">	
									<ul>
									<li><h3>Customer Transactions</h3></li>
									<p>Contains <b>540.000+ rows</b> of customers transaction from several countries. The columns are :
									<ul><li><b>InvoiceNo:</b> Invoice number. Nominal, a 6-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each transaction. If this code starts with letter 'c', it indicates a cancellation.</li>
									<li><b>StockCode:</b> Product (item) code. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each distinct product.</li>

									<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
								</header>
								<header class="text">
									<p>We need to make sure the data is clean enough before analyzing the data to get unbiased analysis. The cleaning steps are :</p>
									<ul>
									<li><h3>Handle missing value</h3></li>
									<p>
										After running missing value check, there are <b>135080</b> missing rows on customer ID and <b>1454</b> missing rows on description column.
										Then, further research is needed to decide what we need to do with rows with missing value. From the research, it turns out that 
										rows with missing customer ids have identical values in the "gender", "age", and "income" columns. Therefore, for data consistency and to eliminate redundancy, rows with missing customer ids need to be removed from the dataset.
									</p>
									<script src="https://gist.github.com/muhammadnadhir6/1105688fbed77ed6dabaaf461170464e.js"></script>
									<li><h3>Remove negative value</h3></li>
									<p>
										From the table decription above, we know that there are zero and negative values in "Quantity" and "UnitPrice" column.
										The quantity column with negative value and has a letter "C" as the start of the InvoiceNo. are non-sales operations 
										(cancellations, accounting entries, stock count entries, sales discount entries, out of use, etc).
										The "D" in the "StockCode" column represents sales discounts, and the negative values in the "Quantity" column are a result of these discounts.
										In the "StockCode" column, entries starting with "C" contain information related to transportation, as evident 
										from the "Description". In the "StockCode" column, there are rows consisting only of numbers, as well as 
										patterns such as "BANK CHARGES," "PADS," "POST," "M," "NUMBERC," "NUMBERA," and others. The 'M' values in the 
										"StockCode" and the "Manual" values in the description do not represent a product. It is assumed that not a sale 
										but it may be a payment type or method or cost.

									<h2>EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)</h2>
									<h3>Top 10 Country With The Highest Total Revenue</h3>
								</header>
								<header class="text">
									<p>
										Before we start the data exploration, we need to make a column for total value per transaction that calculated from unit price and quantity.
									</p>
									<script src="https://gist.github.com/muhammadnadhir6/227e86550a7002d510d8b693745e2222.js"></script>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/top10_revenue.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>As we can see from the plot, it is proven that the highest revenue belongs to United Kingdom. 
										We can't clearly see the difference between the other countries as UK revenue is incompararably higher than the other countries.</p>

								<header class="text">
									<p>##Top 10 Country Without UK With The Highest Total Revenue
										To clearly see the difference between countries other than UK, we need to make the plot again without UK to see 
										more precisely the difference between the countries.</p>

									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/top10_withoutUK.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										There is not much difference in revenue beetween Netherland, EIRE/Ireland, Germany, and France. Then there is
										a huge difference between France and Australia. There is also a slight difference between the 6th and 7th place which are
										Spain and Switzerland and the 8th, 9th, and 10th place which are Belgium, Sweden, and Japan.

									<p>
										Although the country rank in the top 10 country with the highest customer count is not exactly the same as the top 10 country
										with the highest revenue, the United Kingdom still hold the first place with an incompararably higher customer count than the

									<p>
										Based on the result above, it is better to focus on the United Kingdom market for RFM and Cohort analysis, 
										as it comprises 92,6% of the dataset's customers and 84,7% of the total revenue. This choice most likely to 
										give more consistent results.

									<h2>RFM Analysis</h2>
								</header>
								<header class="text">
									<a class="image submain"><img src="images/RFM.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										In the age of the internet and e-commerce, companies that do not expand their businesses online or 
										utilize digital tools to reach their customers will run into issues like scalability and a lack of digital 
										precsence. An important marketing strategy e-commerce businesses use for analyzing and predicting customer 
										value is customer segmentation. Customer data is used to sort customers into group based on their behaviors 
										and preferences.
									</br>
									</br>
										Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value (RFM), also known as RFM analysis, is a type of customer segmentation 
										and behavioral targeting used to help businesses rank and segment customers based on the recency, frequency, 
										and monetary value of a transaction.
									<ul>
										<li>RECENCY (R) : Time since the last purchase</li>
										<li>FREQUENCY (F) : Total number of purchases</li>
										<li>MONETARY (M) : Total purchase value</li>
									</ul>
									</p>
								</header>
								<header class="submajor">
									<h3>Benefits of RFM Analysis</h3>
								</header>
								<header class="text">
									<p>
									<ul>
										<li>Recognize our most valuable customers</li>
										<li>Find out potential customers</li>
										<li>Increase revenue</li>
										<li>Increase customer retention</li>
										<li>Learn more about the trends and behaviors of our customers</li>
										<li>Find out customers that are at risk</li>
									</ul>
									</p>
								</header>
								<header class="submajor">
									<h3>Calculating RFM</h3>
								</header>
								<header class="text">
									<p>
										The first thing we need to do is calculating RFM of each customer. Recency calculated from day difference between
										customer's last purchase and reference date. Reference date is one day after the last purchase date. Frequency
										calculated from each customer purchase count and monetary calculated from the total purchase value of each
										customer.
									</p>
									<script src="https://gist.github.com/muhammadnadhir6/30c6c1ee7e1196528a1e437bdd7f264a.js"></script>
								</header>
								<header class="submajor">
									<h3>Calculating RFM Score</h3>
								</header>
								<header class="text">
									<p>
										The simplest way to create customer segments from an RFM model is by using quartiles. We will assign a score 
										from 1 to 4 to each category (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) with 4 being the highest/best value. 
										The final RFM score is calculated by combining all RFM values. Then we will use the final RFM score for customer segmentation.
										Here are the segmentation :
										<ul>
											<li>
												<b>Recency (R) :</b>
											</br>If Recency value is equal or less than 18, then the Recency score is 4 
											</br>If Recency value is between 18 and 51, then the Recency score is 3 
											</br>If Recency value is between 51 and 143, then the Recency score is 2 
											</br>If Recency value is more than 143, then the Recency score is 1
											</li>
											<li>
												<b>Frequency (F) :</b>
											</br>If Frequency value is equal or more than 10, then the Frequency score is 4 
											</br>If Frequency value is between 10 and 5, then the Frequency score is 3 
											</br>If Frequency value is between 5 and 2, then the Frequency score is 2 
											</br>If Frequency value is 1, then the Frequency score is 1
											</li>
											<li>
												<b>Monetary (M) :</b>
											</br>If Monetary value is equal or more than 1576.585, then the Monetary score is 4 
											</br>If Monetary value is between 1576.585 and 652.280, then the Monetary score is 3 
											</br>If Monetary value is between 652.280 and 300.280, then the Monetary score is 2 
											</br>If Monetary value is less than 300.280, then the Monetary score is 1
											</li>
										</ul>

									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/rfm_score_distribution.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Most of the customers have RFM score of 111, which means that the have purchased only once in 144 or more days ago with transaction value less than 300.280.</p>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/recency_distribution.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>According to the pie chart, customers recency score are almost evenly distributed.</p>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/frequency_distribution.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Most of the customers did a purchase 2-4 times, 34.4% did a purchase only once, 16.9% did a purchase 5-9 times, and the rest did a purchase more than 10 times.</p>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/monetary_distribution.png" alt="" /></a>

									<h3>RFM Segmentation</h3>
								</header>
								<header class="text">
									<p><ul><li>According to the Recency score, customers with a score of 1 are defined as a lost customer, customers with a score of 2 and 3 are defined as an old customer, and customers with a score of 4 are defined as a new customer.</li>

									<li>According to the Monetary score, customers with a score of 1 and 2 are defined as a normal customer, and customers with a score of 3 and 4 are defined as a top spent customer.</li>
									<li>Lastly, customers with a score of 4 in all aspect are defined as noble customer.</li></ul></p>

									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/segmentation_distribution.png" alt="" /></a>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/segmentation_pecentage.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Most of the customers or around 24.9% is a lost customer which mean they made a purchase at least 144 days 
										ago. Among all customers, only 7 of them are new regular customers which mean they made a purchase 1 day ago. 
										Lastly, we found out that 6.6% of the customers are a noble customer which means they have a high purchase 
										value from frequent purchases and the last time they made a purchase was 1 day ago.</p>

								<header class="submajor">
									<h2>Cohort Analysis</h2>
								</header>
								<header class="text">
									<a class="image submain"><img src="images/cohort_analysis.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										Cohort analysis involves grouping customers together based on shared characteristics or behaviors and then 
										analyzing their behavior over time. The purpose of Cohort Analysis is to understand how different groups of 
										customers behave or respond to certain events or changes. Cohorts are typically defined by a common 
										attribute or characteristic, such as the month of customer acquisition or a specific marketing campaign. 
										By tracking and comparing the behavior of different cohorts, businesses can gain insights into customer 
										retention, engagement, and other key metrics.
									</p>
									<p>
									</br>
										Cohort Analysis is specifically useful in analyzing user growth patterns for products. In terms of a product, 
										a cohort can be a group of people with the same sign-up date, the same usage starts month/date, or the 
										same traffic source. Cohort analysis is an analytics method by which these groups can be tracked over time 
										for finding key insights. This analysis can further be used to do customer segmentation and track metrics 
										like retention, churn, and lifetime value.

										<li>Learn more about the trends and behaviors of our customers</li>
									</ul>
									</p>
								</header>
								<header class="submajor">
									<h3>Making Cohort Index</h3>
								</header>
								<header class="text">
									<p>
										What we need to do first is making cohort index using first transaction dates. The number of cohort index
										is equal to the number of date. That first purchase count in each month will be the standard to measure 
										retention rate from the next months until the last month.
									</p>

								</header>
								<header class="submajor">
									<h3>Retention Rate</h3>
								</header>
								<header class="text">
									<p>
										Retention rate is the percentage of customers who continue to use our service or product over a 
										predetermined period. It's an important metric, especially for subscription-based businesses, as it shows 
										the numer of existing customers compared to total customers in the early period. In this research, we will
										see month to month customer retention rate. Started with new customer count in each date then we will compared
										the amount in the next month.
									</p>
									<script src="https://gist.github.com/muhammadnadhir6/8e52bd2c150d5f5fd1008f7bee1d726c.js"></script>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/customer_retention.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>As we can see, there is already a significant decrease of customer in the second month after each first purchase date, 
										although the number of customers in the next months tends to be stable. Some even experience an increase as happened
										in November 2011 or twelfth month after December 2010, which increased to 50%.
									</p>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/retention_rate.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Although there was some decline in average retention rate in each index, the retention rate tends to increase compared to the
										early period.</p>

									<h3>Retention Rate by Gender</h3>
								</header>
								<header class="text">

									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/retention_by_gender.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>It shows that both female and male groups have similar retention trends. It means that there is no significant 
										relationship between gender and customers retention.
									</p>
								</header>
								<header class="submajor">
									<h3>Retention Rate by Age</h3>
								</header>
								<header class="text">
									<p><ul>
										<li>Customer with age 15-29 defined as a Young Customer</li>
										<li>Customer with age 30-54 defined as a Mid-age Customer</li>
										<li>Customer with age higher than 55 defined as an Old Customer</li>

									<h2>Recommendation</h2>
								</header>
								<header class="text">
									<p>
										Based on the result we got from the analysis, there are some recommendation that can help us upgrade our
										business in maintaining better relationship with our customer, reach our potential customer, and carry out a 
										better customer based marketing strategies.
									<ul>
										<li>
											According to RFM Analysis, 24,9% or the majority of customers is a lost customer which means that they made a 
											purchase at least 144 days ago. The best thing that we can do for them is actively advertising some products
											through app notification or message app marketing. It is better if the product is a popular product or a product
											related to prior purchases. We could also make a special discount voucher for this customer segment.
										</li>
										<li>
											The second largest customer segment is an old customer which means that the last time they made a purchase are
											18-143 days ago. These customers can also be categorized as cusomers at risk. We can maintain them by 
											actively advertising some products through app notification or message app marketing and giving them
											time limited discount voucher.
										</li>
										<li>
											For top spent and noble customer regardless of their last purchase, we can give them discount voucher with 
											minimum purchase or a discount for second or third product that they purchase. We can also give them cashback for
											a expensive products to maintain their loyalty to our retail.
